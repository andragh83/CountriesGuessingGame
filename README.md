# Countries Quizzes
Quizzes about world countries built with ReactJs and styled with Tachyons. 
I initially used state-full Class components, then switch to hooks, and lastly switched to Redux for storing most of the state, as I enhanced the app. 
I fetch the countries data from an external source and I reuse components for different quizzes.
